- Lec-00:
	- Libraries: OpenGL, DirectX;
	- Modeling
		- Geometry
		- Materials
		- Light
	- Animation
	- Rendering
	- Pipeline:
		- 1. Ray Casting; 2. Rendering;
		- 1. Transformation; 2. Clipping; 3. Rasterization; 4. Visibility;
- Lec-01: Bézier Curves and Splines:
	- General principle: control points;
	- **Cubic Bezier Curve**;
	- (1-t)^3, 3t(1-t)^2, 3t^2(1-t), t^3 for P1, P2, P3, P4;
	- **General formulation: Q(t)=GBT(t)**;
	- [x(t),y(t)]'=GBT; Geometry G=(P1,P2,P3,P4); Bernstein B=spline matrix; T=[1,t,t^2,t^3] canonical monomial basis;
	- Subdivision of a Bezier Curve; De Casteljau Construction;
- Lec-02: Curve Properties & Conversion, Surface Representations;
	- Order of Continuity: C0, G1, C1, C2;
	- **Cubic B-Splines**;
	- **NURBS** (Generalized B-Splines): Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline;
	- Representing Surfaces:
		- 1. Triangle meshes; simple, but need not smooth; (need a lot to approximate smooth by tessellation);
		- 2. Tensor Product Splines; **bilinear matrix product**: P(u,v)=T(u)'B'GBT, i.e. P(u,v)=(B1(u),..,B4(u)) (4x4 of 16 points) (B1(v),..,B4(v)); 
		- 3. Subdivision surfaces;
		- 4. Implicit surfaces, e.g. f(x,y,z)=0; Efficient boolean and check inside; hard to generate/sample point?
		- 5. Procedural;
	- Displacement Mapping;
	- Corner cutting (Chaikin’s Algorithm) produces a quadratic B-Spline curve! (Magic!)
- Lec-03: Coordinates and Transformations;
	- Basis [b1,b2,b3], v=[b]c; c: coordinates;
	- Another basis [a1,a2,a3]=[b]M, then coodinates in [a] is inv(M)c;
	- **Frames**: origin plus basis;
	- Transformation S in another frame: **inv(A)SA, similar transform**; transform to the frame, apply S, transform back;
	- Non-commutative;
	- Homogeneous coordinates;
	- Perspective: non-linear transform;
	- **Photo Tourism**: apply transforms in a lot of photos without 3D reconstruction;
	- Tangent space: v-new=Mv **Covariant**;
	- Normal: n-new=inv(M)n **Contravariant**;
- Lec-04: Hierarchical Modeling;
	- Scene graph;
	- Traversal: stack;
	- **Articulated models**: rigid parts connected by joints;
	- **Forward kinematics**:
		- Given the skeleton parameters p (position of the root and the joint angles) and the position of the point in local coordinates vs, what is the position of the point in the world coordinates vw?
		- Not too hard, just apply transform accumulated from the root.
	- Inverse kinematics;
		- Given the current position of the point and the desired new position in world coordinates, what are the skeleton parameters p that take the point to the desired position?

- Lec-06: Animation, Skinning/Enveloping;
	- Principles of Traditional Animation Applied to 3D Computer Graphics. SIGGRAPH'87;
	- **Squash**: flatten an object or character by pressure or by its own power;
	- **Stretch**: used to increase the sense of speed and emphasize the squash by contrast;
	- Types of Animation (overview)
		- Keyframing:
		- Procedural: Describes the motion algorithmically; Express animation as a function of small number of parameters;
		- Physically-based: Anthony C. Fang and Nancy S. Pollard. Efficient Synthesis of Physically Valid Human Motion, TOG'03
	- Animation Controls;
	- Character Animation using skinning/enveloping;
		- Skeletal Subspace Deformation (SSD): also named vertex blending, matrix palette skinning, linear blend skinning;
- Lec-07: Particle Systems and ODEs;
	- Physically based; focused on **particle system**;
	- More advanced versions of behavior: flocks, crowds;
    - **Cloth**: Selle. A, Su, J., Irving, G. and Fedkiw, R., Robust High-Resolution Cloth Using Parallelism, History-Based Collisions, and Accurate Friction. TVCG'09
    - **Fluid**: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
    - **Fluid**: Navier-Stokes Equations;
    - Properties:
    	- Particle motion influenced by external force fields and internal forces between particles
		- Particles created by generators or emitters
			- With some randomness
		- Particles often have lifetimes
		- Particles are often independent
		- Treat as **points** for dynamics, but rendered as anything you want

	- Phase space:
	- Euler's Method: inaccurate, will diverge for circular case (step-size does not help!);
	- Midpoint, Trapezoid, Runge-Kutta;
	- N-body system: generally n^2;
		- **Fast Multipole Method**, Greengard and Rokhlin, J Comput Phys 73, p. 325 (1987)
	- Dampling: f=-dv;
	- Spatial fields: wind, attractors, ...
	- Flocks (Boids);
		- Each bird modeled as a complex particle (boid);
			- Separation, alignment, cohesion;
			- http://processing.org/learning/topics/flocking.html
	- Star Trek 2: one of the earlies particle systems;
		- Particle Modeling [Reeves 1983]: The entire lifetime of the particle is drawn at once;
- Lec-08: Particle Systems and ODE Solvers II, Mass-Spring Modeling
	- 2nd order method: trapezoid method
		- f0 = f(X0, t0);
		- f1 = f(X0+h, t0+h);
		- X(t0+h) = X0 + h(f0+f1)/2;
		- 2nd order means error goes down with h^2, the equation is still 1-st order!
