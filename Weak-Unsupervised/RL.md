- Count-based Exploration: Bellemare DeepMind
- Curiosity (Pathak, Efros), Random Network Distillation (OpenAI), Go-Explore (Uber AI)
- Forms of Unsupervised Learning:
	- Generative
		- Density model (PixelCNN, GPT-x, Bigan)
		- Masked auto-encoding (BERT, Electra)
	- Non-generative (contrastive like)
		- Siamese (SimCLR, MoCo, AMDIM, BYOL, SimSiam, DINO, Barlow Twins)
		- Contrastive prediction (CPC)

## UL/Represention Learning for RL:
- Learn world models; Dyna (fake rollouts), Model-Based RL
- Non-Generative (Contrastive-like)
- Use as an auxiliary task to speed up (sample-efficiency) RL

		- **Predict other agent** 1. immediate action (policy); 2. consumed object (goal); 3. trajectory (successor representation).
		- VAE on character embedding: generate mean and variance;
		- DVIB for penalty

## Reward-Free RL
- Reward-Free Pre-Training:
	- Pre-train without task reward available
	- Leverage pre-training to learn faster once task reward is available
- Intrinsic reward:
	- Three types:
		- Knowledge-based: Surprise / unpredictability / how much learned about world from experience
		- Competence-based: Empowerment / Skills
		- Data-based: Entropy (i.e. coverage) of data collected
	- Legacy:
