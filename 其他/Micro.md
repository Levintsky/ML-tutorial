## Mankiw Part V: Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry
- Chap-13: The Cost of Production
	- Profit = Total revenue - total cost;
	- Economic profit = revenue - explicit cost - implicit cost
	- Accounting profit = revenue - explicit cost
	- Average and marginal cost
		- average fixed cost (independent on Q)
		- average variable cost (depends on Q)
		- marginal cost
	- average total cost: ATC=TC/Q
	- MC = dTC/dQ
	- efficient scale: the quantity of output that minimizes average total cost
	- Costs in short run/long run:
		- Factory size: fixed in short run, variable in long run;
	- Economies and diseconomies of scale;
	- Sunk cost;
- Chap-14: Firms in Competitive Markets
	- competitive market:
		- Many buyers, sellers;
		- Similar product;
	- Max-profit:
		- Price = marginal cost;
		- Long-run decision: exit if TR < TC
		- Profit = TR - TC = (P-ATC)Q
	- Supply Curve in a competitive market;
		- Short term;
		- Long term: profitable, incentive for new firms to join; At the end of this process of entry and exit, firms that remain in the market must be making zero economic profit;
		- Supply: dPrice/dQ = 0
Chap-15 Monopoly;
	- monopoly: a firm that is the sole seller of a product with- out close substitutes
	- natural monopoly: a single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a smaller cost than could two or more firms;
		- dcost/dQ < 0
	- Demand curve;
		- Competitive: dPrice/dQ = 0
		- Monopoly: dPrice/dQ < 0
	- Max-profit:
		- Marginal Cost = Marginal Revenue;
		- Monopolist profit = (P-ATC)Q
		- P>MR=MC, (P=MR=MC for competition);
		- The slope of dMR/dQ < dPrice/dQ < 0, so always supply < max-utility;
	- Welfare cost of monopoly:
		- Wedge: deadweight loss;
	- Price discrimination;
		- Can achieve max-utility if we know everyone's utility of the product;
	- Public policy toward monopolies;
		- Increasing competition with antitrust laws;
		- Regulation: price = MC
			- For natural monopoly: lose money;
- Chap-16: Monopolistic Competition;
	- Oligopoly: a market structure in which only a few sellers offer similar or identical products;
	- Monopolistic competition: a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical
	- Short run; (P-ATC)Q
	- Long run; P=MR=ATC>MC, Q < efficient scale (still short);
	- Efficient scale: P=MC
- Summary (comparison):
	- Perfect competition / Monopolistic competition / monopoly;
	- Max profit: MR=MC / MR=MC / MR=MC
	- Profittable short run: Y / Y / Y
	- Price taker? Y (P=MC) / N (P>MC) / N (P>MC)
	- Welfare-maximization? Y / N / N
	- Number of firms: Many / Many / One
	- Profittable long run: N / N / Y
- Chap-17: Oligopoly;
	- Game theory;
	- Markets with a few sellers;
	- Competition, monopolies and cartels;
		- collusion: an agreement among firms in a market about quantities to produce or prices to charge
		- cartel: a group of firms acting in unison
		- Nash equilibrium
	- Economics of Cooperation;
		- Prisoners' dilemma;
		- Dominant strategy: high production;
		- Best: all low production;
	- Public policy toward oligopolies;
		- Restraint of trade and the antitrust laws;

## Mankiw Part VI: The Economics of Labor Markets

	- Political philosophy of redistributing income;
		- Utilitarianism: maximize total utility of everyone;
			- utility: a measure of happiness or satisfaction
		- liberalism: the political philosophy according to which the government should choose policies deemed just, as evaluated by an impartial observer behind a veil of ignorance;
			- maximin criterion the claim that the government should aim to maximize the well-being of the worst-off person in society
			- social insurance:	government policy aimed at protecting people against the risk of adverse events

		- Condorcet paradox: the failure of majority rule to produce transitive preferences for society;
		- Arrow's impossibility theorem: a mathematical result showing that, under certain assumed conditions, there is no scheme for aggregating individual preferences into a valid set of social preference:
			- Unanimity: If everyone prefers A to B, then A should beat B.
			- Transitivity: If A beats B, and B beats C, then A should beat C.
			- Independence of irrelevant alternatives: The ranking between any two outcomes A and B should not depend on whether some third outcome C is also available.
			- No dictators: There is no person who always gets his way, regardless of everyone else's preferences.
		- Median voter is king;
			- median voter theorem: a mathematical result showing that if voters are choosing a point along a line and each voter wants the point closest to his most preferred point, then majority rule will pick the most preferred point of the median voter;
		- Politicians are people too;
	- Behavioral economics: the subfield of economics that integrates the insights of psychology
