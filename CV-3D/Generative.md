	- Input: voxel; output: mesh parts (triangles);
	- Unsupervised?
	- Each part (z, q, t): z, shape; q rotation; t translation;
	- Loss design:
		- Coverage loss: distance of primitives; penalize to confirm O in Pm
		- Consistency loss:
	- Variable number of primitives: (z, q, t, p), p binary for existence
	- REINFORCE; parsimony reward for fewer parts
