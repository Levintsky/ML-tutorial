## Reward-Free-RL 2. Competence
- Empowerment:
	- Measures the optionality a (perfect) agent can create over its future;
	- r = max.p(a.tn) I(A.tn; St+n)
- Designs: MI(z;τ) = H(z) - H(z|τ)
	- Which RL algorithm is used?
	- State-based or image-based (only DISCERN is image based)
	- Termination conditions of episodes affect learning signal
	- When state-based, which variables to include in τ?
- Maximize MI: 
	- SSN4HRL: r = logq(z|st; φ) - logp(z)
	- VIC: r = logq(z|sH; φ) - logp(z)
	- DIAYN: r = logq(z|st; φ) - logp(z)
	- VALOR: r = logq(z|s1:H; φ) - logp(z)
	- DISCERN: r = logq(z|s1:H; φ) - logp(z)
	- relative-VIC: r = logq(Ω|sT,s0;φ) - logq(Ω|s0;φ)
	- DADS: r = logq(st+1|st,z;φ) - logq(st+1|st;φ)
	- VISR: r = DIAYN + successor features;
- Asymmetric Self-Play (ASP)
	- Key Idea: two-player game, Alice challenges Bob, which encourages Alice to try new things (explore) and Bob to acquire skill
	- Alice set goal to Bob, Bob acts;
	- Alice intrinsic reward: max(0, tB-tA)
	- Bob reward: -tB
	- tA, tB: completion time;
