## Mix-Integer Programming
- Classic
	- Cutting plane method;
- MIP + DL
	- Take-aways:
		- These types of trained networks can be modeled as a MIP and embedded into another optimization problem.
		- there are ways to accelerate the solution process of these MIPs by understanding the polyhedral geometry
	- MIP commercial solver: gurobi
	- M Fischetti and J Jo. Deep Neural Networks as 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Programs: A Feasibility Study. 2017
		- x = RELU(wy+b)
		- option 1: wy+b=x-s, s.t., x >= 0, s >= 0;
		- option 2: z = 0,1 for +/-, 
	- R Anderson, J Huchette, W Ma, C Tjandraatmadja, J Vielma. Strong mixed-integer programming formulations for trained neural networks. 2019
		- Contained in tf.opt, will be open source;
		- Experiments: Faster MNIST;

	- A Ferber, B Wilder, B Dilkina, M Tambe. MIPaaL: Mixed Integer Program as a Layer. 2019
		- Take-away: We can handle "hard convex problems" using cutting planes
		- Forward Pass: solve MIP
		- Backward Pass: construct an LP to approximate the MIP exactly at the solution using cutting planes;
