## Mix-Integer Programming
- Classic
	- Cutting plane method;
- MIP + DL
	- Take-aways:
		- These types of trained networks can be modeled as a MIP and embedded into another optimization problem.
		- there are ways to accelerate the solution process of these MIPs by understanding the polyhedral geometry

		- x = RELU(wy+b)
		- option 1: wy+b=x-s, s.t., x >= 0, s >= 0;
		- option 2: z = 0,1 for +/-,

		- Contained in tf.opt, will be open source;
		- Experiments: Faster MNIST;

		- Take-away: We can handle "hard convex problems" using cutting planes
		- Forward Pass: solve MIP
		- Backward Pass: construct an LP to approximate the MIP exactly at the solution using cutting planes;
