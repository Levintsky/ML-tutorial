# Program Synthesis

## Bayesian Program Induction
- MIT
	- **Learning Libraries of Subroutines for Neurally–Guided Bayesian Program Induction**, NIPS 2018

## Translation
- Tree-to-tree Neural Networks for Program Translation (Berkeley), NIPS 2018
	- Each language to parse tree as IR (intermediate representation);
	- Learn mapping function with tree-to-tree network;
	- Tree encoder for source language with Tree-LSTM;
	- Decoder: (1) attention; (2) source encoding; (3) combined encoding; (4) argmax + softmax;

## Applications: regard a problem as program synthesis
- Univ of Edinburgh, Google Brain. HOUDINI: Lifelong Learning as Program Synthesis, NIPS 2018
	- Problem: lifelong learning
	- Neural libraries for lifelong learning
	- Functional programs represent deep architecture
	- Symbolic program synthesis to choose: which to re-use? put them together?
	- Differentiable, fine-tuned by gd
