## Uncertainty
- **BMAML** Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Yoshua Bengio, NIPS 2018)
	- BMAML
	- Add uncertainty on both initial model and update
	- Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
	- Extend uncertainty-awareness to meta-update
- **Probabilistic Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning** (Chelsea Finn, NIPS 2018)
	- Uncertainty
	- A graphical model view

## Detection
- Bingyi Kang, Zhuang Liu, Xin Wang, Fisher Yu, Jiashi Feng, Trevor Darrell. Few-shot Object Detection via Feature Reweighting. 2018
	- Built on YOLOv2
	- Assumptions: feature can be reused, different features play important roles in specific classes
	- Train a meta-conv module as weight, to reweight features
