# Causal Inference

## Basics
- Problem setup:
	- If A -> B? (e.g. rain -> umbrella, but umbrella -/-> rain);
		- Causal or correlation;
	- Common approach: A/B test or meta-learning;
		- Effect: E[f(B)|A] - E[f(B)|not A]
- Representation:
	- Find correct DAG;
	- Approach 1: constraint-based;
		- Test conditional independence;
		- Iteratively delete edges;
	- Approach 2: score-based;
		- G = argmax s(D|G)
