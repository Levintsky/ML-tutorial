	- Key 1: program generator needed a lot of pretrain on large synthetic (block-level LSTM); manually designed program to generate, 
	- Key 2: executor trained on part-level separately; to make generator-executor differentiable;
	- Key 3: the domain gap between the synthetic and ShapeNet is still large;
