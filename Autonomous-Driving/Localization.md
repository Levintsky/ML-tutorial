- Problem setup:
	- Sensors (input):
		- GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)
		- Camera
		- IMU
	- State space (output): 3-dof;
		- Latitude, Longitude, yaw;
- Approaches:
	- GPS/RTK;
	- Geometric Alignment: ICP;
	- Place Recognition;

	- Real-time localization with centimeter level accuracy;
	- Intensity-Map -> [CNN] -> emb1;
	- Lidar-Sweeps -> [CNN] -> emb2;
	- emb1, emb2, gps, ... -> [âŠ—] -> 3-dof;

	- Motivation: HD-Map too large fro storage; (900G for LA, 168T for USA)
	- Learn to binarize the map features;
	- Run-length encoding on top of Huffman coding;
	- Image compression (DL-based): encoding - quantization - decoding;
- Retrieval-based localization at city scale: new dataset and simple baselines. Mini-1
	- Problem: localize SDV with single image/sweep
	- Image: SFM/SLAM for structure, PoseNets for regression, VLAD/NetVLAD/DenseVLAD/BoW for retrieval
	- LiDAR: HD-Map/ICP for structure, ? for regression, PointNetVLAD/PCAN/LPD-Net for retrieval

## SLAM
- Asynchronous Multi-View SLAM.
	- Extend SLAM to **asynchronous** multiple cameras;
	- Asynchronous BA;
	- New frame tracking;
	- Exp: comparison with orb-slam;
