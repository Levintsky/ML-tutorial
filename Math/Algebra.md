			- a · b = b · a
		- Additive and multiplicative identity:
			- there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in F such that a + 0 = a and a · 1 = a
		- Additive inverses: for every a in F, there exists an element in F, denoted −a, called the additive inverse of a, such that a + (−a) = 0.
		- Multiplicative inverses: for every a ≠ 0 in F, there exists an element in F, denoted by a−1 or 1/a, called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that a · a^(−1) = 1.
		- Distributivity of multiplication over addition:
			- a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c).

- Lie group: a group whose elements are organized **continuously and smoothly**, as opposed to discrete groups:
	- in which the group operations of **multiplication and inversion** are **smooth** maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication;
	- GL(2): general linear group
	- SL(2), SO(2): special linear group, determinant=1;
	- SO(2), SO(3): rotation group
- Lie algebra:
	- Definition:
		- Bilinearity;
		- Alternativity: [x, x] = 0;
		- Jacobi identity: [x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0;
		- Anticommunity: [x,y]=-[y,x];
	- Lie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds: any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is its tangent space at the identity
