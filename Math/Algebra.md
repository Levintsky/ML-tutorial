		- Def: The homomorphism φ: G ~ G' is called a **monomorphism** if φ() is 1-1. A monomorphism that is onto is called an **isomorphism**. An isomorphism from G to G itself is called an **automorphism**.
		- Def: Two groups G and G' are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism of G onto G'.

			- then H is a subgroup of G, H ⊃ K and H/K ~ H'. Finally, if H' is subnormal G', then H is subnormal of G.
		- Theo: (Second Homomorphism Theorem). Let H be a subgroup of a group G and N <| G. Then HN = {hn | h ∈ H, n ∈ N} is a subgroup of G, H n N is a normal subgroup of H, and H/(H n N) ~ (HN)/N.
		- Theo 2.7.4: (Third Homomorphism Theorem). If the map φ: G ~ G' is a homomorphism of G onto G' with kernel K then, if N' <| G' and N = {a ∈ G |φ(a) ∈ N'}, we conclude that G/N ~ G'/N'. Equivalently, G/N ~ (G/K)/(N/K).

			- φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ R.
		- Def Let R be a ring. A nonempty subset I of R is called an **ideal** of R if:
			- I is an **additive subgroup** of R.
			- Given r ∈ R, a ∈ I, then ra ∈ I and ar ∈ I.
		- Left ideal: a set L: additive subgroup, r ∈ R, a ∈ L, ra ∈ L. Similarly, right ideal;
		- Lemma 4.3.1. If φ: R ~ R' is a homomorphism, then Ker(φ) is an ideal of R.
		- K: ideal of R. R/K exists; merely the set of all cosets a+K for a ∈ R.
		- Theo 4.3.2. Let K be an ideal of R. Then the quotient group R/K as an additive group is a ring under the multiplication (a + K)(b + K) = ab+K. Furthermore, the map φ: R->R/K defined by φ(a)=a+K for a ∈ R is a homomorphism of R onto R/K having K as its kernel. So R/K is a homomorphic image of R.
		- **Theo 4.3.3 (First Homomorphism Theorem)**. Let the mapping φ: R -> R' be a homomorphism of R onto R' with kernel K. Then R' ~ R/K; in fact, the mapping ψ: R/K -> R' defined by ψ(a+K) = φ(a) defines an isomorphism of R/K onto R'.
		- **Theo 4.3.4 (Correspondence Theorem)**. Let the mapping φ: R -> R' be a homomorphism of R onto R' with kernel K. If I' is an ideal of R', let I={a ∈ R|φ(a) ∈ I'}. Then I is an ideal of R, I⊃K and I/K~ I'. This sets up a 1-1 correspondence between all the ideals of R' and those ideals of R that contain K.
		- **Theo 4.3.5 (Second Homomorphism Theorem)**. Let A be a subring of a ring R and I an ideal of R. Then A+I={a+i|a∈A, i∈I} is a subring of R, I is an ideal of A+I, and (A+I)/I ~ A/(A∩I).

## Abstract Algebra
- Group;
	- **Group**:
		- A set with binary operation (G, .)
		- Closure: for a, b in G, a.b in G.
		- Associativity: (a.b).c=a.(b.c)
		- Identity: e.a=a.e
		- Inverse: for a in G, ∃ b, s.t. a.b=b.a=e
		- Group homomorphism:
			- G -> H: injective (G, .), (H, \*)
			- a(g.k) = a(g) \* a(k)
		- Orthogonal group: O(n)
			- (Ax, Ay) = (a, b), det(R) = +/- 1
			- Special orthognal group SO(n): det(R) = +1
			- Special Euclidean group SE(n)
	- Semigroup;
		- Associative: (a.b).c=a.(b.c)
- Ring and Field;
	- **Ring**:
		- A set R with two binary operation: +, .
		- R is abelian group under +:
			- Associative: (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
			- Commutative: a+b=b+a
			- Additive identity: ∃ 0, s.t., 0+a=a
			- Additive inverse: -a, s.t. a+(-a)=0
		- R is monoid under multiplication
			- Associative: (a.b).c=a.(b.c)
			- Identity: ∃ 1, s.t., a.1=1.a=a
		- Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition:
			- a ⋅ (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c)
			- (b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a)
	- **Field**:
		- Associativity of addition and multiplication:
			- a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
			- a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c.
		- Commutativity of addition and multiplication:
			- a + b = b + a
			- a · b = b · a
		- Additive and multiplicative identity:
			- there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in F such that a + 0 = a and a · 1 = a
		- Additive inverses: for every a in F, there exists an element in F, denoted −a, called the additive inverse of a, such that a + (−a) = 0.
		- Multiplicative inverses: for every a ≠ 0 in F, there exists an element in F, denoted by a−1 or 1/a, called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that a · a^(−1) = 1.
		- Distributivity of multiplication over addition:
			- a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c).

		- https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook
- Lie group: a group whose elements are organized **continuously and smoothly**, as opposed to discrete groups:
	- in which the group operations of **multiplication and inversion** are **smooth** maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication;
	- GL(2): general linear group
	- SL(2), SO(2): special linear group, determinant=1;
	- SO(2), SO(3): rotation group
- Lie algebra:
	- Definition:
		- Bilinearity;
		- Alternativity: [x, x] = 0;
		- Jacobi identity: [x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0;
		- Anticommunity: [x,y]=-[y,x];
	- Lie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds: any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is its tangent space at the identity
