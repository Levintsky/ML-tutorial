	- nonhomogeneous systems: Ax=b;
- Eigen-value, Eigen-vector, normal form;
	- Orthogonal Matrix;
	- Same linear transformation under different basis: B=inv(P)AP
	- **Similar matrix**: B=inv(P)AP, iff A, B have the same eigen polynomial;
	- **Diagonalizable matrix**;
		- Rotation matrix is not diagonizable;
	- **Minimal polynomial**: according to Hamilton-Cayley, a nxn matrix's order is at most n;
		- If A has minimum polynomial (lambda-a)^n, then it is aI+B, where B satisfy B^n=0;
		- **Jordan normal form**;
		- Cyclic subspace; I, f, ff, ...
		- If A's minimum polynomial can be factorized to 1st order products, then it has Jordan norm form; (not working for complex eigen cases)
		- If both matrices have the same Jordan form, then they are similar;

	- Real symmetric matrix:
		- All eigenvalues are real;

	- **Normal matrix**: AA\*=A\*A;
	- if A is normal matrix, then A is diagonizable by inv(P)AP
	- Orthogonal space; isometric, anisometric;
		- Orthogonal transform: transform J, f(a,b)=f(Ja,Jb);

		- https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook
- Lie group: a group whose elements are organized **continuously and smoothly**, as opposed to discrete groups:
	- in which the group operations of **multiplication and inversion** are **smooth** maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication;
	- GL(2): general linear group
	- SL(2), SO(2): special linear group, determinant=1;
	- SO(2), SO(3): rotation group
- Lie algebra:
	- Definition:
		- Bilinearity;
		- Alternativity: \[x, x\] = 0;
		- Jacobi identity: \[x,\[y,z\]\]+\[y,\[z,x\]\]+\[z,\[x,y\]\]=0;
		- Anticommunity: \[x,y\]=-\[y,x\];
	- Lie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds: any Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is its tangent space at the identity
