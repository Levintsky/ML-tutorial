	- 5-1: The International Flows of Capital and Goods;
		- Y=C+I+G+X
		- Y-C-G=I+NX (left national saving)

	- 5-2: Saving and Investment in a Small Open Economy
		- Capital Mobility and the World Interest Rate
		- How Policies Influence the Trade Balance?
			- Fiscal expansion (increase in government purchase, cut in tax): trade deficit
			- Fiscal expansion abroad: trade surplus
			- Shift in investment schedule;
			- Evaluating Economic Policy
		- The U.S. Trade Deficit
	- 5-3: Exchange Rates;
		- Nominal and Real Exchange Rates;
		- The Nominal Exchange Rate The nominal exchange rate is the relative price of the currencies of two countries;
		- The Real Exchange Rate The real exchange rate is the relative price of the goods of two countries
		- dNX/deps < 0 (eps: real exchange rate)
		- eps=e P/p (adjusted by price)
		- Trend: dexchange/dinflation>0
	- Conclusion: The United States as a Large Open Economy
	- Summary:
		- Loanable Funds: S=I+CF,
		- Supply constant
		- d(I+CF)/dr < 0, higher interest rate -> lower demand;
		- Net capital outflow CF: dCF(r)/dr < 0
		- Net exports NX=CF: dNX/dr < 0
		- e.g. Reduction in S, supply line shifts left, r+, CF-, eps+
		- e.g. Increase in Invest demand, demand shifts right, r+, CF-, eps+
		- e.g. protectionist, supply/demand/CF/r remains unchanged, import restriction increase net export, NX(eps) moves right, exchange rate eps+
- Chap-6: Unemployment
	- 6-1: Job Loss, Job Finding, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment
		- L=E+U
		- Equilibrium: fU=sE (finding job=losing job)
		- U/L=s/s+f
	- 6-2: Job Search and Frictional Unemployment
		- The unemployment caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job is called frictional unemployment.
		- Causes of Frictional Unemployment:
			- sectorial shift;
		- Public Policy and Frictional Unemployment
